## Done

	> Numpy : Numerical Python

		>> numpy array is correspond to python list

			1. All element dtype is equal

			2. Cannot change size of array

			3. High perform of Numerical power based on C, 				 C++

			4. No check dtype because of C, C++ syntax

			5. So fast, providing by **broadcast** feat.

			6. Act like vector, apply for machine learning

			7. Fancy indexing, masking

	> Pandas : Python Data Analysis for structured data

		>> Pandas is correspond to MS Excel
		But, specialize high option data


			1. DataFrame = Structured data

			2. Set of Serials = D.F.

			3. Powerful indexing, masking

			4. read or to a various of file extension

	> Seaborn : Beautiful Visualization based on matplotlib

		>> It is well interact with Pandas

			1. Histplot: histogram

			2. Displot: contain histplot, kde, ecd plot

			3. Barplot: bargraph

			4. Countplot: x or y is Count value

			5. Boxplot: avg, +-25% range, outlier

			6. Violinplot: specialize how to distribution

			7. Lineplot: the relation of x-y change

			8. Pointplot: error bar about specific data

			9. Scatterplot: general distribution of x-y

			10. Pairplot: All feature relationship of DF

			11. Heatmap: Degree of correlation with x-y

## To Do

	- more and more package of python

	- Crawler
